# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

## 1.2.0 (2026-11-13)

First release as **Loopsmith** (previously *YouTube Section Loop*).

- Works beyond YouTube: YouTube Music, Spotify, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Vimeo, Twitch, Bilibili and
  Dailymotion out of the box, and any other site with a video or audio player once turned on from
  the toolbar popup.
- Loop markers on each site's own progress bar, found automatically on unknown sites.
- Overlapping loops: the status shows the loop actually in charge, and "Next loop" plays the next
  loop from its own start.
- Loops are stored in extension storage, shared across sites; loops from 1.x are migrated.
- Chrome support (Manifest V3), alongside Firefox (Manifest V3, Firefox 128 or later).
- The panel is isolated from the site's styles (Shadow DOM).

## 1.1 and earlier

*YouTube Section Loop*: A-B repeat for YouTube only, as a Firefox extension and a userscript.
